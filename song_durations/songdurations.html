        <h2>I: Introduction</h2>
        <p class="writing">
            There is no doubting the effect that the app TikTok has had on the way that media is produced
            and consumed since its

            <a href="link.com">launch in the U.S. in 2018.</a>

            Short-form content has made its way into almost
            every social media app and has changed the way many people receive entertainment.

            There has been talk online that modern popular music artists are catering towards being easily formatted
            into
            short-form content, <u>which has had the effect of shortening songs in general</u>.
            <br></br>
            I decided to test this out.
            <br></br>
            I hypothesize that the most popular songs (Billboard Top 100) in the U.S. have gotten shorter
            since the launch of TikTok in 2018. The relevant population data would be any song that had
            charted within the year on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., which is based on sales (physical and
            digital), online streaming, and radio airplay in the U.S. This gives us an idea of what the most
            popular songs for an entire year in the United States. I decided to choose the past 20 years, since
            2004.

        <h2>II: Data Description</h2>
        <p class="writing">

            <text class="subsection">Cleaning</text>
            <br></br>

            My data comes from a dataset on the data science platform
            <a href="kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>
            called
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suparnabiswas/billboard-hot-1002000-2023-data-with-features">Billboard
                Hot-100 [2000-2023] data with features.</a>


            The dataset did include durations for each song, however there were lots missing. Using Python and the
            Spotify API I got the song durations myself.
            The data cleaning included extracting the song name, artist, chart year, and duration (in
            seconds).

            <br></br>
            <text class="subsection">Final Sample</text>
            <br></br>
            I decided to include duplicate songs across years because I am focused on what types of
            songs and durations people are listening to in any given year.

            The final sample was just the top
            100 Year Single from the entire year, because I don't have the Spotify API credits to collect the data for
            any song that had charted on the Hot 100 during the entire year.

            <br></br>
            Therefore, we are
            missing some popular songs, but we get a good idea of what the popular conscience in the U.S.
            was during each year. Out of the 2400 expected songs and duration, Spotify failed to find durations for 16 songs. 
            
            Therefore, the final sample has 2,384 songs and their durations since 2000.
